    "You can refer to the Jupyter Notebook Tutorial - Out of School Children Rate in Uganda as an example and tutorial of some data visualization techniques while you complete this Notebook assignment. You may want to be in touch with your group members to each run different analyses that look at different markers of marginalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this assignment, each member of your group will need to select:\n",
    "1. A country of your group's interest that is in the WIDE dataset\n",
    "2. One set of unique indicator (AKA outcome variable) \n",
    "    Depending on the avaliability of data in your country of choice, examples of indicators include: \n",
    "         1) Out of School Children Rate at primary, lower secondary and upper secondary level:\n",
    "               'eduout_prim_m', 'eduout_lowsec_m', 'eduout_upsec_m'\n",
    "         2) Completion rate at primary, lower secondary and upper secondary level:\n",
    "               'comp_prim_v2_m','comp_lowsec_v2_m', 'comp_upsec_v2_m'\n",
    "         3) Percent of people aged 18-22 years attending higher education\n",
    "               'attend_higher_1822_m'\n",
    "         4) Over-age primary school attendance\n",

    "         5) Transition rate to lower secondary school and transition rate to upper secondary school\n",
